# SecureChat

SecureChat is an end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) real-time chat application built with React for the frontend, Socket.io for real-time messaging, and MongoDB with Express.js for the backend. It uses RSA encryption to generate private and public keys on the client side, ensuring secure communication.
